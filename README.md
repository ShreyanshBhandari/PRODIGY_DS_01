# Visualizing-AgeDistribution
 I tackled my first project: creating a histogram to understand age distribution in a population.

Here's how -Understanding the Task: The goal was to see how ages are spread out in a group, helping us grasp its diversity and trends.

Coding Journey: Using Numpy and Matplotlib, I wrote code to generate random ages and group them into bins (like 0-9, 10-19, etc.).

Creating the Chart: The histogram I made showed the number of people in each age group, giving a clear picture of age distribution.
Insights Revealed: The histogram helped quickly understand if a population had more young or older people and how evenly ages were distributed.
